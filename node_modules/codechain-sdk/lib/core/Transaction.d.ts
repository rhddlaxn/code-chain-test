 * A unit that collects transaction and requests processing to the network. A parsel signer pays for CCC processing fees.

 * - Its seq must be identical to the seq of the account that will sign the tx.
 * - It contains the transaction to process. After signing the Transaction's size must not exceed 1 MB.
 * - After signing with the sign() function, it can be sent to the network.
